commands to do:

$ export FLASK_APP=home.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0

Moreover you need to go on http://webtech-02.napier.ac.uk:5000/
I don't know why but when I run my uwsgi and run my python app, when I go on the port 80 I have this message "internal server error"
So to run my app we need to use the port 5000 and a development environement 

Sorry for this mistake
